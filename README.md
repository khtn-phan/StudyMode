# Study Mode 167 - Minimal MVP


This is a lightweight single-page implementation (HTML/CSS/JS) for Study Mode 167.


Files:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling (blue theme)
- app.js — application logic (localStorage persistence)


Features implemented:
- Focus Mode: Pomodoro timer (25/50 min), single-task enforcement, auto-suggest Reflection Mode at session end
- Memory Mode: Add flashcards, SRS with simple intervals (1,3,7,14 days), active recall workflow
- Deep Mode: Feynman analysis helper and a simple mindmap builder
- Reflection Mode: Save reflections and show weekly summary


How to run:
1. Place files in a folder and open index.html in a browser.
2. All data is stored in browser localStorage.


Notes & next steps:
- This is an MVP. For production, consider server-side storage, user accounts, notifications, and richer mindmap visuals.
